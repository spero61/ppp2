## Exercises

1.  Draw a rectangle as a **Rectangle** and as a **Polygon**. Make the lines of the **Polygon** red and the lines of the **Rectangle** blue.

2.  Draw a 100-by-30 **Rectangle** and place the text “Howdy!” inside it.

5.  Draw a red ¼-inch frame around a rectangle that is three-quarters the height of your screen and two-thirds the width.

6.  What happens when you draw a **Shape** that doesn’t fit inside its window? What happens when you draw a **Window** that doesn’t fit on your screen? Write two programs that illustrate these two phenomena.

7.  Draw a two-dimensional house seen from the front, the way a child would: with a door, two windows, and a roof with a chimney. Feel free to add details; maybe have “smoke” come out of the chimney.

8.  Draw the Olympic five rings. If you can’t remember the colors, look them up.

9.  Display an image on the screen, e.g., a photo of a friend. Label the image both with a title on the window and with a caption in the window.

10. Draw the file diagram from §12.8.

11. Draw a series of regular polygons, one inside the other. The innermost should be an equilateral triangle, enclosed by a square, enclosed by a pentagon, etc. For the mathematically adept only: let all the points of each **N**-polygon touch sides of the **(N+1)**-polygon. Hint: The trigonometric functions are found in **<cmath>** (§24.8, §B.9.2).

12. A superellipse is a two-dimensional shape defined by the equation
    ![superellipse_equation](https://i1.wp.com/habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b54/910/2d2/b549102d23f6e0da26f0ca6b21760b14.png?resize=390%2C145&ssl=1)
    Look up superellipse on the web to get a better idea of what such shapes look like. Write a program that draws “starlike” patterns by connecting points on a superellipse. Take a, b, m, n, and N as arguments. Select N points on the superellipse defined by a, b, m, and n. Make the points equally spaced for some definition of “equal.” Connect each of those N points to one or more other points (if you like you can make the number of points to which to connect a point another argument or just use N–1, i.e., all the other points).

13. Find a way to add color to the lines from the previous exercise. Make some lines one color and other lines another color or other colors.
