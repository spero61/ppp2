## Thoughts

I see this exercise is devised to recall the statements of the textbook.

Recall that Dr. Stroustrup's advice on page 224
"It is unwise to make major structural changes to gain a minor advantage"

Modify the calculator to operate on ints (only) provides us a minor version change,
but it requires a major structural change which also needs a substantial amount of time considering I am a novice.
I might revisit to finish the work 'more precisely as described in the textbook' later.

Dr. Stroustrup also mentioned in the textbook as below:
"It is essential that you don’t get stuck in an attempt to learn “everything” about some language detail or technique"
Bjarne, Stroustrup. Programming (p. 8). Pearson Education. Kindle Edition.

Consequently, I would follow his advice by doing this exercise as markdown rather than c++ implementation.

I may check this exercise later and do it on my own if I have too much free time to use.
For that, I leave a link to a specific page of StackOverflow as below:
