# exercise09_11.md

## Statement

Design and implement a set of useful helper functions for the Date class with functions such as next_workday()
(assume that any day that is not a Saturday or a Sunday is a workday) and week_of_year()
(assume that week 1 is the week with January 1 in it and that the first day of a week is a Sunday).

# exercise09_12.md

Change the representation of a Date to be the number of days since January 1, 1970 (known as day 0),
represented as a long int, and re-implement the functions from §9.8.
Be sure to reject dates outside the range we can represent that way
(feel free to reject days before day 0, i.e., no negative days).

Implement those from §9.8.

## Comment

As we have developed the idea of Calendar from the simplest possible,
(assume days of month is 31, leapyear was not considered)
I need to revise the Chrono thoroughly.

I will try to come back and do the exercise again later.

> However, we hope that we have provided exercises that are hard enough to challenge anybody and enough exercises to exhaust even the best student’s available time. We do not expect you to do them all, but feel free to try.
