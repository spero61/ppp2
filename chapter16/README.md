## Wisdom

> GUI is a form of I/O, and separation of the main logic of an application from I/O is among our major ideals for software. Wherever possible, we prefer to have a clean interface between our main program logic and the parts of the program we use to get input and produce output.
>
> Such a separation allows us to change the way a program is presented to a user, to port our programs to use different I/O systems, and — most importantly — to think about the logic of the program and its interaction with users separately.

> One implication of this "**control inversion**" is that the order of execution is completely determined by the actions of the user. This complicates both program organization and debugging. It is hard to imagine what a user will do and hard to imagine every possible effect of a random sequence of callbacks. This makes systematic testing a nightmare.
