# exercise 11_09.md

## Statement

Split the binary I/O program from ยง11.3.2 into two:
one program that converts an ordinary text file into binary and
one program that reads binary and converts it to text.

Test these programs by comparing a text file
with what you get by converting it to binary and back.

## Implementations

### program part 1

Input: [little_prince.txt](https://github.com/spero61/ppp2/blob/main/chapter11/little_prince.txt)

Text to binary: [exercise11_09_txt_to_bin.cpp](https://github.com/spero61/ppp2/blob/main/chapter11/exercise11_09_txt_to_bin.cpp)

Output: [exercise11_09.bin](https://github.com/spero61/ppp2/blob/main/chapter11/exercise11_09.bin)

### program part 2

Input: [exercise11_09.bin](https://github.com/spero61/ppp2/blob/main/chapter11/exercise11_09.bin)

Binary to text: [exercise11_09_bin_to_txt.cpp](https://github.com/spero61/ppp2/blob/main/chapter11/exercise11_09_bin_to_txt.cpp)

Output: [exercise11_09.txt](https://github.com/spero61/ppp2/blob/main/chapter11/exercise11_09.txt)
