// Q. Can we declare a non-reference function argument const (e.g., void f(const int);)?
// A. Yes.

// What might that mean? Why might we want to do that? Why donâ€™t people do that often?
// A. That might mean that the function argument is passed-by-const-reference.
//    As if you try to change the value of that argument in the function, compiler catches the error.
//    People do not often do this because in this way it is obligated to use pass-by-const-reference only.
//    And might be confused with 'pass-by-value' as it does not contain ampersand(&) character.

// Try it; write a couple of small programs to see what works.
